      <li><strong>Flight chaos? - A Rocky Start :</strong> Travel is rarely smooth, and my journey was no exception. A delayed flight from Paris turned my well-planned afternoon arrival into an evening scramble. Still, stepping off the plane at Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER), I felt the rush of excitement—I was finally in Berlin!</li>
      <li><strong>Navigating to Tiergarten - RER 8:</strong> Berlin’s public transport is legendary, and rather than wasting money on a cab, 
      I took the RER 8 into the city. The efficiency was impressive, and before I knew it, I had arrived in Tiergarten, one of Berlin’s largest parks and the perfect backdrop for my marathon weekend.</li>

      One of the most inspiring parts of my pre-race experience was attending the screening of <strong>“Behind the Team”</strong> at <strong>Babylon Cinema</strong>, a historic venue dating back to 1929. This wasn’t just a film—it was a cinematic portrait of greatness, culture, and discipline.

      The Berlin Marathon isn’t just 42.195 kilometers — it’s a moving masterpiece. A story told in cadence, cobblestone, and collective breath. It’s the kind of race that leaves footprints not only on the course, but on your character.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the electrifying echoes of cheering crowds along Unter den Linden to the hushed reverence of the Holocaust Memorial, Berlin becomes more than a backdrop — it becomes your co-runner. Your rhythm. Your reward.
    </p>

    <p>
      My race may have ended at the Brandenburg Gate, but Berlin’s impact didn’t stop there. The city unraveled itself layer by layer — through its food, its music, its contradictions. And somehow, in all that chaos and clarity, it gave something back.
